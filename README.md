# RideShare: Blockchain solution to our riding problems
## Cryptology and Security Tools Final Project
---

## 1. About the project
RideSharing is an application that assists in making deals between drivers and clients without a middleman in order to ensure both sides have a fair opportunity in the terms of thesee deals. Instead of using a traditional payment method such as cash or credit/debit cards, RideSharing allows transactions using blockchain and smart contracts technologies. The transactions are executed in a bidding format and use the Ether crypto asset as their currency.

### Deliverables
- [X] Deliverable # 1 - MOC of User Interface
- [X] Deliverable # 2 - System Infrastructure
- [ ] Deliverable # 3 - Exam Workshop

### Built with
